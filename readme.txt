Visualize your stories by pinning posts to images.

== Description ==

### ADD MARKER TO IMAGES AND LINK TO RELEVANT POSTS TO IT
Simply create a gallery of images and add related posts to this images as pins.

---

### SIMILAR TO GOOGLE PINS ON MAPS OR FACEBOOK TAGGING PEOPLE AND PLACES
We use this technique creating relationships between images to posts or images to images. Meaning, if the user clicks on an image pin a popover gets displayed with a short information of the pinned post. The best is - you can decide what should be displayed in the popover and have full control over the template.

---

### USE CASE EXAMPLE
One of our clients has a car community and they were in need of a tagging feature that allows their community members tagging pictures of tuning parts. With this plugin they are now able to engage directly on the image.

---

### A POWERFUL TOOL FOR NEW AND INTUITIVE DESIGN AND USER EXPERIENCES
Use it to create interactive stories like a journals and display relevant posts to the images.

---

### USE MULTIPLE FORMS FOR DIFFERENT PIN TYPES
Create Multiple forms for different pins and enable your authors/ community members to only fill out the form elements needed for their particular pined post.

---

### BUDDYFORMS HOOK FIELDS SUPPORT
You can use the “BuddyForms Hook Fields” extension to hook your gallery into the single view of your posts.

---

### TEMPLATE TAGS SUPPORT
To all theme developers! Use buddyforms_easypin_gallery() as a ‘template tag’ anywhere in your single template.
